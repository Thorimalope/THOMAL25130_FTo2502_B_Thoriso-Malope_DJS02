# ðŸŽ§ Podcast Preview Web Component

This project includes a custom HTML element called `<podcast-preview>` that displays a podcast preview card. It shows the podcastâ€™s image, title, number of seasons, genres, and when it was last updated. When a user clicks the card, a modal with more details can be opened.

## âœ… What It Does

- Renders podcast information in a styled card
- Uses Shadow DOM to keep the styles and layout separate from the rest of the page
- Accepts podcast data dynamically using JavaScript
- Opens a modal when the card is clicked
